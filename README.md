Document-Similarity-Detection
=============================

Rapid miner package for detection of document dimilarity based on keyword matching

A simple inplementation of document similarity detection using keyword matching.

Does not take semantics into consideration. 

Rapid miner package extracts the keywords and throws the output to the csv files. The C++ program does the necessary 
processing for finding the top n keywords of a document and also roughly summarizes the document.
